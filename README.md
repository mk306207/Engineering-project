# 2026 Engineering project - visualization of genetic algorithm  
As my final step in my Engineering studies, this project focuses on implementing and visualizing a genetic algorithm, showing how populations evolve to find optimal or near-optimal solutions to complex problems. To make the concept more intuitive and engaging, I decided to visualize it using a simple arcade-style game, where each individual in the population is represented as a player attempting to reach a goal through evolutionary processes.  

# Virtual enviroment setup  

## Create 'venv' folder
```bash
  python -m venv venv
```  
## Run 'activate' script from 'venv' folder
```bash
  .venv\Scripts\activate
```  
## Install python libraries from 'requirements.txt'
```bash
  pip install requirements.txt
```
